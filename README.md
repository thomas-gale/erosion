# erosion
ðŸšœ particle physics based erosion game

## plan (in no particular order)
- learn https://www.babylonjs.com/ (or I might just stick with tried and tested https://threejs.org/)
- make some arty stuff in https://www.aseprite.org/
- build the core physics mechanic in https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi and it's wonderful mpm 'elements' library https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi_elements
- compile the core physics mechanic to CPU WASM https://taichi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/export_kernels.html (in the future maybe help tachi support compiling to the shiny new https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/ spec)
- make this stack into a game that's somewhat fun...
